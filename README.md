# Lecture2 Group18_HealthBuddy

## Project Description
Our web application is a simple and effective solution for tracking daily calorie intake and exercise plans. It entails key features including calorie tracking, exercise tracking, and goal setting for food, exercise and weight control, which makes it a comprehensive solution for users who want to keep track of their health and fitness. 

The scope of this app spans across three main fields, which includes food intake, exercise, and goals setting and tracking. To elaborate, firstly, food tracking allows users to easily check food calorie content and track food items consumed. Secondly, exercise tracking enables users to check calories of their workouts, track exercises done and schedule future exercises. Last but not least, our dashboard offers visualisations of multiple aspects of food consumption and exercise activities, as well as the progress in achieving the goals set for food, exercise and weight control. These features are designed to help users make informed decisions about their health and fitness goals, thereby promoting healthy lifestyle practices.

Our web application is mainly designed for working adults who are enthusiastic about tracking and achieving their fitness goals, but face challenges to do so with traditional tracking methods due to their busy schedules. A total of 24 user stories were implemented in this project.

This web application uses Vue.js and Node.js as the primary framework, and uses programming languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. With Firebase as the backend, we used Firebase Authentication for user registration and Firebase Firestore for data storage. Git and GitHub are used for version control. Our web application is tested on multiple web browsers, including Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge. External libraries such as FullCalendar, VueChartkick, Chart.js, and Vuex are incorporated for additional functionality. Furthermore, we adopt an Agile development framework, with SCRUM management styles. We incorporated 2 sprints and weekly stand-ups to ensure that our sprints meet the sprint goals. By utilising the above mentioned technical stacks and methodology, we aim to deliver a high-quality web application that gives good user experience and meets the needs of our target audience.
